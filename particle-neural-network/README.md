# Particle Neural Network Tutorial

This is a tutorial to implement a feedforward neural network from scratch in Python in under 200 lines. The training technique is using a particle swarm optimization algorithm.

Refer to <a href="./particle-neural-network-tutorial.ipynb">`particle-neural-network-tutorial.ipynb`</a> for the tutorial. If you want to jump straight to the code, <a href="./code/particle_network_uc.py">`code/particle_network_uc.py`</a> is the uncommented code and <a href="./code/particle_network.py">`code/particle_network.py`</a> is the commented code.
