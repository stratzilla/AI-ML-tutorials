# Tutorials

This is a collection of tutorials I've written on various artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms and topics. As a disclaimer, at the time of writing these, my knowledge is not perfect and in many cases, I am learning how best to implement them as I'm writing them. Code may not be perfect and better tutorials may exist, I just want to keep these for posterity and for my own reference. Consider these all beginner-level approaches to implementation.

### <a href="https://github.com/stratzilla/genetic-algorithms-tutorial">Genetic Algorithms</a>

In this tutorial I explain an implementation of a genetic algorithm which attempts to optimize the Styblinski-Tang function in two dimensions although the algorithm is generalized to any dimensions. One-Point Crossover and Uniform Mutation genetic operators are implemented.

### <a href="https://github.com/stratzilla/k-means-tutorial">K-Means Clustering with K-Means++ Initialization Strategy</a>

In this tutorial I explain an implementation of the K-Means Clustering algorithm using both random and K-Means++ initialization strategies. I also discuss the Dunn Index and how it can be used to find an optimal `k` parameter for the algorithm in case `k` is not known a priori. 

### <a href="https://github.com/stratzilla/neural-network-tutorial">Neural Network using Backpropagation Training</a>

In this tutorial I explain an implementation of a feedforward neural network using backpropagation training. The example data set is the Iris set but the implementation is generalized to any input data. I also briefly discuss hyperparameter selection by examining the effect of different learning and momentum rates.
