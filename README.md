# Tutorials

This is a collection of tutorials I've written on various artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms and topics. As a disclaimer, at the time of writing these, my knowledge is not perfect and in many cases, I am learning how best to implement them as I'm writing them. Code may not be perfect and better tutorials may exist, I just want to keep these for posterity and for my own reference. Consider these all beginner-to-intermediate-level approaches to implementation.

Feel free to distribute, edit, make changes, improve, etc. these tutorials to your hearts desire. All I ask is if you publish any of them elsewhere, please let me know and link back.

### <a href="https://github.com/stratzilla/genetic-algorithms-tutorial">Genetic Algorithms</a>

In this tutorial I explain an implementation of a genetic algorithm which attempts to optimize the Styblinski-Tang function in two dimensions although the algorithm is generalized to any dimensions. One-Point Crossover and Uniform Mutation genetic operators are implemented.

### <a href="https://github.com/stratzilla/particle-swarm-optimization-tutorial">Particle Swarm Optimization</a>

In this tutorial I explain an implementation of a particle swarm optimization algorithm which attempts to optimize the Schwefel function in two dimensions although the algorithm is generalized to any dimensions.

### <a href="https://github.com/stratzilla/k-means-tutorial">K-Means Clustering with K-Means++ Initialization Strategy</a>

In this tutorial I explain an implementation of the K-Means Clustering algorithm using both random and K-Means++ initialization strategies. I also discuss the Dunn Index and how it can be used to find an optimal `k` parameter for the algorithm in case `k` is not known a priori. 

### <a href="https://github.com/stratzilla/neural-network-tutorial">Neural Network using Backpropagation Training</a>

In this tutorial I explain an implementation of a feedforward neural network using backpropagation training. The example data set is the Iris set but the implementation is generalized to any input data. I also briefly discuss hyperparameter selection by examining the effect of different learning and momentum rates.

### <a href="https://github.com/stratzilla/genetic-neural-network-tutorial">Neural Network using Genetic Algorithm Training</a>

In this tutorial I explain an implementation of a feedforward neural network trained using a genetic algorithm. The example data set is the Wheat Seeds set but the implementation is generalized to any input data. This tutorial presupposes you've read the Genetic Algorithms and Neural Network using Backpropagation tutorials as while I start from scratch, I do not repeat much information as covered therein.

### <a href="https://github.com/stratzilla/particle-neural-network-tutorial">Neural Network using Particle Swarm Optimization Training</a>

In this tutorial I explain an implementation of a feedforward neural network trained using a particle swarm optimization algorithm. The example data set is the Wine set but the implementation is generalized to any input data. This tutorial presupposes you've read the Particle Swarm Optimization and Neural Network using Particle Swarms tutorials as while I start from scratch, I do not repeat much information as covered therein.

## Stuff I'm Working On

Eventually I hope to add these tutorials at some point:

- Hill Climbing
- Breadth-first/depth-first Searches using N-Queens
