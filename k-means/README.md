# K-Means Tutorial

This is a simple tutorial to implement K-Means in Python using a K-Means++ initialization strategy in under 150 lines. Additionally, there's some discussion around choosing an optimal `k` value using the Dunn Index as well as some plots. The tutorial goes through the methodology of K-Means, its implementation, and even considers naive approaches versus more informed approaches to initialization.
