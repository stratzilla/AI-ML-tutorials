# Genetic Algorithms Tutorial

This is a simple tutorial to implement a basic genetic algorithm in Python in under 150 lines using only Python standard libraries. Specific genetic operators implemented are uniform mutation and one-point crossover.

Refer to <a href="./genetic-algorithms-tutorial.ipynb">`genetic-algorithms-tutorial.ipynb`</a> for the tutorial.
